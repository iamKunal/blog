Hey there! I am Kunal Gupta, a Computer Science Undergraduate at IIT Indore. I am mainly interested in Computer Security, Software Development and Big Data.
I am currently involved in a Big Data Analysis project at IITI since a few months ago. 

I actively participate in CTF competitions as and when they happen. I also practice and solve problems related to reversing, pwning and forensics on various online platforms (pwnable.kr, Backdoor.SDSLabs etc). Last November, I participated in [CSAW CTF Finals](https://csaw.iitk.ac.in/archives/2016/ctf_finalists.html) (as a part of Team H4x0r) held at IIT Kanpur which was a thrilling experience.
I also take part in competitive programming competitions sometimes.

I _used to_ [play Dota](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Assaxor) quite a lot, but after quitting it I play computer games ocassionally for recreation. I have always been interested in how computer systems work and interact, thus I can mostly be found tinkering with OS and its features.
