CTFs with pwn/re/for @ ByteBandits, IITI
```
Hey there! I am Kunal Gupta, a Computer Science Undergraduate at IIT Indore. I am mainly interested in Computer Security and Software Development.
Last summer, I interned at [CodeNation, Bangalore](http://codenation.co.in/) where I worked to design a platform to make meetings more efficient.


As a part of [ByteBandits](https://twitter.com/BanditsByte) I actively participate in CTF competitions as and when they happen.
I also practice and solve problems related to reversing, pwning and forensics on various online platforms.
<!--I also take part in competitive programming competitions sometimes.-->

I _used to_ [play Dota](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Assaxor) quite a lot, but after quitting it I play computer games ocassionally for recreation. I have always been interested in how computer systems work and interact, thus I can mostly be found tinkering with OS and its features.
