Software Development Engineer
```
I am a software developer, currently working as a Founding Engineer at [AsknBid Tech](https://asknbid.tech). Previously I worked at [CodeNation](https://codenation.co.in/) as an SDE3 on Code Analysis.


I have always been interested in how computer systems work and interact, thus I like to tinker around with Operating Systems. I also like designing systems, so I have a keen interest in Kubernetes and have a [single node cluster at my home up and running](https://github.com/iamKunal/home-k8s-gitops-mirror).

As a part of [ByteBandits](https://twitter.com/BanditsByte) I used to participate in CTF competitions and solve problems related to reversing, pwning and forensics.
My CTF-Time handle is [assaxor](https://ctftime.org/user/18637).


I was a member of IIT Indore's [Programming Club](https://www.facebook.com/pclubiiti/) since 2017 and founded and headed
the Cyber-Security Wing under the same. During my tenure, I was also the overall coordinator and founder of Euristica, the college's Tech Fest.

I _used to_ [play Dota](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Assaxor), but now I mostly watch it on occasion.
