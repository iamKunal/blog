<h1> Welcome to my blog! </h1>
I write mainly about computer security including <a href='/categories/#write-ups'>write-ups to many Capture The Flag problems</a>.

<p>You can use the navigation bar above to know <a href='/about'>about me</a> or view other posts.<br>
  Also, you can use the side bar (for desktop users) to follow me on different platforms and stay updated. Mobile users can do the same by touching the follow button and checking out the links.</p>
<p>You can also start reading my most recent posts below.</p>
<h3>Have a nice day!</h3>
